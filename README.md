# How to Download My Media Addon from GitHub

**Disclaimer**: This addon is for personal use, and I never intend to push it to other public platforms. Some files have been picked out of other sources in the WoW community, and others are personally made.

Follow these steps to download and install the media files from this repository. This media package is designed for use with the **ElvUI Addon**.

## Step 1: Download the ZIP File
1. Go to the repository page.
2. Click the **`<> Code`** button at the top right of the repository page.
3. Select **Download ZIP** to download the repository to your computer.

## Step 2: Extract the ZIP File
1. Locate the ZIP file you just downloaded on your computer (usually in the "Downloads" folder).
2. Right-click the file and select **Extract All...** or use any extraction tool to unzip the file.

## Step 3: Locate the "ElvUI_Media" Folder
1. After extracting, find the folder named **`ElvUI_Media`** inside the unzipped folder.

## Step 4: Install in World of Warcraft AddOns Folder
1. Move the **`ElvUI_Media`** folder to your World of Warcraft AddOns directory:
   - **Path**: `World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns`
   
   Ensure your folder structure looks like this:
   - `World of Warcraft/_retail_/Interface/AddOns/ElvUI_Media`

   You can confirm this by checking your **AddOns** folder after installation.

## Additional Notes
- **ElvUI**: This media package is designed to work with the **ElvUI Addon**. If you don’t have ElvUI installed, you can get it from [Tukui's website](https://www.tukui.org/).
- Make sure **ElvUI** is installed and updated before installing this media addon.

## Troubleshooting
- If the media files don't show up in-game after installation, ensure the **ElvUI** addon is installed and enabled.
- If you don’t see the changes, check that the **ElvUI_Media** folder was placed correctly in the **AddOns** directory and not inside any subfolders.
